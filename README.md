# GainPatterns

The purpose of this package is to allow the plotting of gain patterns. It is assumed that you have the gain pattern in some text file, and wish to plot it. Some basic gain pattern manipulation (like cross-correlation with similar patterns) will be allowed. It would be cool if gain patterns could be generated from simple antennas, but that is not really what this is for.

For now, I will simply plot using PGFPlots, but in the future, I might add PyPlot and allow the user to choose.

This came default with the package when I made it. Not sure what to do with it.
